Hello Mr. Alan.  Please use the server on zip file, (on terminal.  python restaurantserver.py
inside server directory) as I modified it a bit so that the server sends the estimate
Prep time for the items, there was a for loop deleting that parameter for the item
before returning it.

Please update IP address of your machine on RestaurantRepository
val ipaddress

As I couldn’t get to work post, to get prep time back, I’m using the prep time I got from
server response when getting the menu items.

Need to keep working on that post, but I wanted to submit the app.

I also added images to the server  for categories and some menu items so the app looks a bit
nicer.

I didn’t do things i was supposed to but got the app working, sorry for that, after this project
need To go back and revisit view models, learn to get contexts bit better, review lambdas, high
order functions,Companion objects, interfaces, obviously Post, more on retrofit, Moshi ,okhttp,
and Live data.

I think every one is doing much better on those than me.
Their code looks much more fancier/complicated.

Regarding ItunesApp, I did struggle and had to move on, got it working with my own methods though,
there Was no option to submit.

Thank you, Mr. Alan.
